1. Remote_patch.c and Remote_patch.h added to the project location
2. entry hook and exit hook for all mode processing functions.
3. Done necessary declarations in Global.h
4. Added Remote_patch.c in Make file
5. TCH warnings (incompatable pointer to integer assignment) has been
   cleared  in Global.c, Func = rPORinit()
6. Implicit declaration of function ST_TM_gps_data() in GPS_OD.c is 
   been resolved
7. HAL_GPS_Read function incompatible pointer assignment from 
   struct GPS_No to unsigned long int GPS_Buffer_Addr is resolved.


Func execute command
1.GPS config command names are modified
2.Roll_Torquer_ON and Roll_Torquer_OFF names are changed to TC_MTR_ON 
  and TC_MTR_OFF respectively.

3. Reaction wheel TC_Ping_RW1, TC_Ping_RW2, TC_Ping_RW3, and TC_Ping_RW4
   changed to TC_init_RW1 TC_init_RW2 TC_init_RW3, and TC_init_RW4 respectively.
4. Definition of struct HAL_RW_Data_Structure which was in HAL_RW.h is now
   defined in HAL_Global.h
5. rRW_init_cmd is called in Telecommand.c instead of Function rRW_Ping_TC1,
   rRW_Ping_TC2, rRW_Ping_TC3, and rRW_Ping_TC4 which are now eliminated.

6. Func exe EEPROM_CHECK_COMMAND  is replaced by S_band_tx_on
